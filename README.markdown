DOQ API
=======

This is a interface programmed to make object transactions with databases easy to secure, read, write, and simply program. Programmed in JavaScript and tested with [nodeJS]( https://github.com/joyent/node).

Description
-----------

For those of you have had the desire to have an object relational database using your object, and not have to make a middle ware framework for every type of database, or program. This project was made to make my job easier, more portable, and more flexible as a web developer.
